# ðŸ“Š ML Internship Tasks â€” Certura

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mahad Umar Qaisrani, and this repository contains all three tasks I completed during my Machine Learning internship with **Certura**. Each task involved solving a real-world ML problem using Python and popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Predict House Prices

**Objective:** Build a regression model to predict house prices based on demographic and geographic features from the California Housing dataset.

**What I Did:**
- Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas.
- Trained a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluated the model using RMSE.
- Visualized actual vs predicted house prices using a scatter plot.

**Output:**
- RMSE value showing the prediction error.
- Visualization of prediction accuracy.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Spam Email Classifier

**Objective:** Build a model to classify emails as spam or not using natural language processing (NLP).

**What I Did:**
- Preprocessed text data (lowercasing, removing symbols).
- Used TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.
- Trained a Naive Bayes classifier.
- Evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Output:**
- Achieved ~98% accuracy on test data.
- Clearly classified spam vs ham messages.

## ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Visualize Feature Importance

**Objective:** Train a model on the Titanic dataset and visualize which features contribute most to predicting survival.

**What I Did:**
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
- Encoded categorical values like gender and embark location.
- Trained a Random Forest classifier.
- Visualized feature importances using a horizontal bar chart.

**Output:**
- Ranked features like fare, age, and passenger class based on their impact.
